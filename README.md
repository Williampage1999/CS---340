How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I wrote programs that are not only maintainable and readable, but also adaptable, by developing code solutions that seamlessly integrate with each other.

What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The great thing about working this way is that it makes it easier to spot and fix issues and to reuse code effectively, thanks to the compatibility of the solutions. I'm excited to leverage the CRUD Python module to craft code that's not only testable but also comes with built-in conditions to help me identify and resolve errors more smoothly.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I approached this problem by putting my technical skills to work, using all the knowledge and resources I had to solve it efficiently. I started by breaking down the client's request into manageable parts and used tools like pymongo to streamline the coding process. My approach varied as I made different design decisions throughout the project. Looking ahead, I plan to use NoSQL databases more extensively to create customized solutions that meet the needs of future clients.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists tackle complex problems with cutting-edge technology, blending creativity with scientific rigor to push the boundaries of what computers can do. This kind of work is vital because it not only solves technical challenges but also drives innovation. In projects like this one, we help companies quickly access crucial information by improving their database and dashboard designs, which in turn boosts their overall performance.
